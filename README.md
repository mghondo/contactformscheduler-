# Foundation for Calendar Booking Appointment schdeuler

This component is meant to serve as, or be added to, a react app that needs a appointment scheduler.

## Key Features

This app, in its current state, restricts the user to scheduling either at the top of the hour, or bottom.

The user is also restricted to "hours of operation" between 8am and 8pm.

### `Military time`

the scroll bar has been adjusted to not have the military time (14:00 ie). instead it shows PM or AM where necessary.

### `Form attributes.`

The state section has a picklist of all 50 states.

### `Email section`

The email section requires an @ symbol and will not submit without it.

### `Required Fields`

All fields are required except Street2

### `<Col> Separator`

Two rows are in place so everything can be seen on a Laptop/Desktop at once.
